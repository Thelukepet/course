## Practical Assignments

### Objectives

The practical work for the course serves two main objectives:

1. Get to know the emerging Big Data platforms in more detail by using them, with a focus on data analysis using Spark.
2. Gain hands-on experience using modern development tools and services, including `git`, `github`, `docker`, `Jupyter notebooks`, *etc.*.

### Completing and Evaluating Assignments

In this course, we use *Github for education* to hand in **brief** reports (like a blog post) about the results of the 
practical work. Standard git functionality serves perfectly for carrying out peer review, and keeping track of 
modifications in response to feedback.

Refer to [assignment 1a](assignments/A1a-blogging.html) for more details about the blogging framework.

### Development environment

Development environment customization: more next week.

### Assignments Schedule

#### February 23rd: Setup blogs

Completing the first assignment is not evaluated. However, I expect that every student will be able 
to create their assignment reports in Markdown and have these converted to HTML at their github page,
and know how to start Spark Notebook on their hardware of choice (be it a laptop, their home computer or
a PC in HG 00.137).

Instructions (assignment A1a):

* [Assignment 1a](assignments/A1a-blogging.html)

#### March 8th: Setup Spark-notebook

The rest of the course depends on a working Spark-notebook setup.
Follow the instructions and get yourself acquainted with Docker and Vagrant.
Once you have the Spark-notebook in your browser, you can practice your Scala by issuing
commands in a newly started notebook.
