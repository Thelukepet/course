## Nijmegen - Spark Data Frame API

The goal of assignment 3 is to carry out an analysis on structured open data.

Start the docker container (refer to [assignment A1.b](A1b-docker.html)
and the [Spark Notebook background](../background/spark-notebook.html)
if necessary).

### Big Data Spark Nijmegen notebook

Download the course's notebook 
[Big Data Spark 101](http://rubigdata.github.io/course/assignments/BigData-Nijmegen.snb).

Open [localhost:9000/tree/BigData](http://localhost:9000/tree/BigData) in your browser, 
and open the notebook you just installed inside your Spark Notebook container.

**When you get stuck, use Piazza to find help from your fellow students and/or me!**

### Blog post 

Imagine writing about an open data project, where you want to explain how your
findings are backed up.
