description: How to complete and turn in assignments

We will follow the *fork method* of completing assignments through Github.

This choice implies that every student can see the work of all others.
Please do not cheat and simply copy work from others, but do feel free to use it for peer review and
helping each other when stuck; and ask questions on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/ru.nl/spring2016/nwiibc036/home)!.

Follow these steps for each real assignment:

1. To start, [**fork** the repository][forking].
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
1. Modify the files and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your solution.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
