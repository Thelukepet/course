## Content over layout

Grading this course will not take into account how beautiful results of the work are formatted.
We more easily focus on content by using **Markdown**, an increasingly popular language used to document code and/or write blogs published on the web.

Markdown is convenient as a tool to publish on the web, *especially* when used in combination with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and [git](http://git-scm.com). Equating webpages to files in a GitHub repository means that we edit and publish a website the exact same way as we version our code:
`git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` the website, *collaboratively and versioned*. When setup correctly, a tool called *Jekyll* will 
automagically convert the markdown into HTML.

## Github for Education

Did you already request your github student pack?
Please go to [github for education](https://education.github.com/pack/join) to get benefits like private repositories.

If you are not yet fluent in `git` and Github, then go ahead and study the 
[online training material](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)
provided by Github. If you are unhappy working with the command line (*a skill which I do recommend taking the 
effort to acquire*), consider Github's [OS X](http://mac.github.com) or [Windows](http://windows.github.com)
tool suites (the Windows one *is* convenient).

## How to Create a Blog Post

After familiarizing yourself with `git` (or refreshing your memory) with the resources above, continue to write a 
mockup blog post in Markdown syntax, as a model of the process of creating the results of an assignment.

Follow **carefully** the instructions provided in this
[tutorial to create a simple site](http://kbroman.org/simple_site/) in Markdown and have it hosted for free.

*Note: details matter; for example, pages written in Markdown that omit the header information will not render 
as HTML, as I learned the hard way myself. Unless you know exactly what you are doing, follow the instructions 
carefully.*

The goal in this first assignment is to just complete your first repository that contains a simple site, 
composed in Markdown, published online for free; with no actual content, just to make sure the process is familiar.
You can use the results of this template as your own **simple site**, and deploy the same steps in the rest 
of the course to bootstrap new blog posts, one for every *real* course assignment.

## Finalize the Test Assignment

When you have finished your test blog post, finalize the assignment by pushing it to the correct 
assignment repository - I distribute this URL via a Blackboard announcement.

Follow this link to the *Classroom for Github* [**Test Blog 2017** assignment](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/bcd47a44179718d82cbaa81d15d80802), login with your github account, and accept the assignment.

This creates a private repository under the `rubigdata` "organization", specifically for this assignment. 
Push the blog post that you wrote as the result of Assignment 1a using the commands "to push an existing 
repository from the commandline", that you find on the github page for this newly created repository: 
`rubigdata/bigdata-blog-2017-USERNAME`.
