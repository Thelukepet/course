## Test B

### Objectives

The objective of Test B is a summative assessment of your understanding of the course material for the _final 6 lectures_ of the course.

Lecture 14 gave a brief recap of part two of the course, including a _learning guide_ of what is important for the test:
[slides (.pdf)](https://blackboard.ru.nl/bbcswebdav/pid-2489806-dt-content-rid-7055557_4/xid-7055557_4) from Blackboard.

### Systems

Lectures 8 and 11 presented systems aspects: streaming data, and accessing individual values.

### Data structures and Algorithms

Lectures 9 and 10 introduced Locality Sensitive Hashing and Inverted Files.

### Dimensionality reduction

Lectures 11 and 12 introduced the topic of dimensionality reduction, and specifically looked into SVD and CUR.

### Course Information

The main source to study is the series of slides for the lectures.

Additional information to help understand the slides and provide extra background:
